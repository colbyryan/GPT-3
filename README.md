### About

This is a follow-along project in which I created a modern responsive react.js website, however I continued on this idea by
adding my own advanced CSS and implemented a local API to render data to the website using Express.js


### Goal of the Project
To sharpen my React.js, CSS, and Express.js skills in building modern responsive real-world websites.
